I really like what Capcom did with this font. It has very readable quality, and the lower case is exceptionally clear while fitting with the upper-case style. Not many fonts pull that off, but Capcom are masters of the 8x8 font.

Not entirely sold on the lower-case Z tho, it looks a little too much like a three.
