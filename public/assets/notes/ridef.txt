Riding Fight is a game that would look at home on the Super NES, and be criticized for a total lack of depth. In keeping with that damning assesment, the font is awful too.

Italic letters are always tricky in an 8x8 grid, and the designer of this font seemed to give up every time it got messy. Messy is, in fact, how I'd describe it. The lower case i isn't italic at all.

Really just bad, overall.
