NMK's Hacha Mecha Fighter is batshit insane, but it's visually amazing, right down to the font. 8 x 8 pixels, full upper and lower case, all the punctuation, <i>in italics!</i> and for good measure there's some Japanese katakana in there as well. Except for the lack of colour options, it's one of the best fonts I've ever seen.
