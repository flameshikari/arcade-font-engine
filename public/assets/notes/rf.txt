I have a soft spot for <i>Raiden</i>. Seibu's shooter raised the bar in the genre, setting new standards and conventions for other games to try and follow. Perhaps it's no coincidence that I love this font then. It's strong, with a unique diagonal gradient: every letter is hand-shaded, so that there's a highlight in the right place and all five gradient colours are used, no matter the size, shape or orientation. Many other fonts, with a flat horizontal gradient or plain fill (like Cave's <i>DoDonPachi</i>) just don't look as nice.
