This is an excellent font, and quite unusual in its excellent use of a very small space. It is, in effect, a 6x5 font. It uses all eight pixels horizontally, two for the surrounding outline, but only seven pixels vertically, preserving an empty pixel for a gap between lines of text.

Small fonts are rare, and even more rarely done this well.
