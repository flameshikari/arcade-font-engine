This is a clean little font with a single darker colour for rudimentary anti-aliasing. The lower case letters are a mixed bag overall, but the upper case set is really great in their own context.

Nearly every letter fills the entire 8x8 grid, and where they don't some steps are taken to ensure they do: the upper case J has a shadow that's two pixels thick, and the lower case k is, frankly, weird.
