I can't quite get my head around this incredibly ambitious and totally unsuitable font. What does a weird pseudo-3D <i>shooting bikini-babes on snakes in space</i> game need with a scripted font this ornate!? It's utterly bizarre, but totally fascinating for its uncaring audaciousness.

The lower case font is a secondary serif face but no one cares.
