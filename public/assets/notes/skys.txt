I really like this old shooter - not because it's particularly good, but 'cause I played it a lot when I was a kid. The font, though, is cool. It's thin, and only six pixels tall, including the dropshadow (so the font itself is only 5). And the zero has a dot inside - how awesome is that?

This same font is used in Sky Adventure, released a year later.
