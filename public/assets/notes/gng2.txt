Like Sega's Shadow Dancer, Capcom's new hardware allowed them to take a good looking font and drive it to the brink of disaster with the greater palette allowed by more powerful hardware. Capcom managed to make it work some of the time, but there are certain colour combinations that take a beautiful character set and muck it all up. Any of these colour variations with a drop-shadow lighter than the font itself tends to look awful. To their credit, it seems that these were never actually used in-game... But still.
