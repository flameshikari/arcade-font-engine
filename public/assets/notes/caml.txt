This is a gorgeous font. Taito didn't stray far from the standard often - like Namco, they stuck with the Classic font more often than not. When they deviated though... Well, the results are in front of you. Cameltry's square fat font is gorgeous to look at, in part because of the colours, but also the shading. No gradient here, just an outline and a simple second colour, which makes some letters look 3D.
