This is a brilliant font. Totally readable at any size, great colours, and a subtle but appealing gradient. Also, in the actual game, a fading laser effect makes it look 200x more awesome than it does here.

Trivia: the dropshadow on this also has a great looking gradient, but it was a lot of extra work to rip, as it matched the background perfectly.
