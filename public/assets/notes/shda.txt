This is a sequel to Sega's earlier Shinobi. Interestingly the new hardware didn't result in a better font: Shadow Dancer's letters are thicker, have a gradient and a 3D look, but the details are compressed and the result, especially at small sizes, seems smudged. Shinobi's font seems to be a little less attractive, but is much more readable for it. When enlarged however the reverse is true: <img src="/api.php/y-shinobi/x-Shinobi's/.png"> plain pixels are harsh to the eyes.
