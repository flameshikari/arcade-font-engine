This font is kind of a failure, IMO. With only eight pixels to work with, clarity is vital, and a stencil font already pushes hard against the limits. Adding a complicated 5-colour diagonal gradient and a matching two-colour drop-shadow makes this font very hard to read. Some combinations work, but most are really just cluttered. Much like the game itself, in fact, Toaplan seems to have tried too hard to pack too much into a container that could not carry it all.
