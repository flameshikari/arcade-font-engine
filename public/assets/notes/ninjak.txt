This is a terrible font. It seems to have been created by someone who was uninterested in the whole process. The whole game is a sort of slap-dash effort, so in that respect the font is perfectly suited.

The more I look at it, the more I don't understand it. The shadow is terribly inconsistent. The capitals K, M and N have missing shadows for, I guess, reasons?

The lower case letters have a higher base than the upper case, and some letters like g and j use this for their descenders, but the lower case p does not. It seems as if the creator gave up halfway. It's not the worst font, but it's close.
