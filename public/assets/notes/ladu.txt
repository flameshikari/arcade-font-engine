It's very unusual for any arcade font to have a break in it, moreso when it impacts legibility as it does here. The cut, and the dark line, make this font very hard to read on most backgrounds. Still, Last Duel is a great game, and this font looks just fine while playing. And, as a futuristic fat font and a rare failure (sorta) from Capcom, it's worth checking out here.

Would probably be cooler with some better colours...
