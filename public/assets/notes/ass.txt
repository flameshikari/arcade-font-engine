This is an unusual font for Namco. Normally they stick to the Classic font, but for this twin-stick tank shooter they used a fairly typical fat-font with a futuristic cut on the top-right. It's very similar to other fat fonts, but has a curious kinship with the Aero Fighters font, which has a cut on the top left.

Once again the gradients are my own addition, they're not from the game.
