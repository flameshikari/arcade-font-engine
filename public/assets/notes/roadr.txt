I have a soft spot for Atari, but I have to admit their game art is average much of the time. This font confounds me, I just don't know what they were trying to achieve.

The weird horizontal gradient almost suggests an attempt to create depth, but it's dark on the left and right sides and the result is more of a horizontal shimmer.

It makes my eyes hurt when I look at it for too long.
