This is a super clean font without any lower case to compromise the aesthetic. It has a sneaky bit of anti-aliasing on some letters with curves, like C, G and Q, but also V. Overall it's gorgeous and clean.

It seems like this was an ancestor to the 'standard' Capcom font used in many games, like Armoured Warriors.
