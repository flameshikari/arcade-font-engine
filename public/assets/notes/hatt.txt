This is a surprisingly nice computer font that's totally inappropriate for use in a soccer game (Taito's Hat Trick Hero '95). Unusually, it has a full lower-case set. The smaller letters aren't always awesome (What's with the R?) and the M and N have strange tails on the top-left, but in all other respects this is one of my favourites.
