There are two fonts in Williams' Robotron, and this is unusual for a bunch of reasons. It's very odd for such an early game - this one released in 1982 - to include more than one font, and it might be the first to include proportional fonts, where thinner characters take less space on the screen. (For the purposes of this font engine however the proportional feature is ignored. Sorry.)

This font includes the computer-style upper case characters, and the smaller high-score characters in the lower-case set.

The lower case set may be the smallest possible legible font, occupying a miniscule 3x5 grid.

Also, Robotron is the best game ever made.
